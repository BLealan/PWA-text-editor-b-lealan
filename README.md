# PWA Text Editor

## Description

By adding additional functionality to some existing code, this app will be used as a simple text editor, for users to write short strings which will be automatically saved between sessions. Utilising various technologies, such as webpack, babel and their associated plug-ins, will make the code more efficient and accessible.

Data is saved with a POST function to IndexedDB, while a GET function will retrieve and siaply all previously data.

The application can also be downloaded from the browser, to be used directly on your local device.

## Installation

- Clone git repository onto your local machine.
- Ensure you are in the correct working folder, and run `npm install` to implement all the necessary dependencies and devdependencies.
- Run `npm start` which will initiliase the application (this will both build the 'dist' folder automatically and launch the server).
- View programme on `http://localhost:3000/`
